<h1>Import Grid Set</h1>

Hydraulic Grid Sets combine a series of depth or water surface elevation grids with frequencies to create a plan for HEC-FDA.
<br>
<br>
To create the proper specifications of the WSP file for HEC-FDA an invert value must be defined for each stationing, because of that requirement, a terrain dataset must be selected as a part of a Hydraulic Grid set.  It is advised that the terrain used to produce the grid files should be selected.
<br>
<br>
Each WSP must be associated with a year, so a year selection based on the analysis years defined for the study has been provided.
<br>
<br>
HEC-FDA requires 8 frequency profiles to define a WSP. To meet these qualifications it is required that 8 grids are defined. Each grid must be associated with a frequency. Grids are expected to be tiled pyramidded compressed GeoTif files.  If they are not, they will be converted when the user selects "Ok". Frequencies must be between 0 and 1.  All grids must be either depth or water surface elevation grids.

<br>
To import a grid set, follow these steps:
<ol>
	<li>Enter the name of the hydraulic data.</li>
	<li>(Optional) Enter a description of the data.</li>
	<li>Select the watershed name.</li>
	<li>Select the year.</li>
	<li>Browse to the location of the gridded data.</li>
	<li>Use the arrows to select the available grids.</li>
	<li>Press the Ok button when finished, or press the close button to cancel.</li>
